## Description

A robust, production-ready job scheduler built with NestJS, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
This scheduler ensures reliable, distributed, and persistent job execution, even in the face of server crashes, restarts, or multiple worker instances.

## Features

1. **Persistent Scheduling**: Jobs are stored in PostgreSQL, ensuring no jobs are lost on server crash or restart.
2. **Crash Recovery**: On startup, the scheduler automatically picks up and processes any missed or overdue jobs.
3. **Polling Mechanism**: Jobs are executed via a polling loop for reliability and persistence.
4. **Recurring Jobs**: Supports daily and weekly recurring jobs.
5. **Email Notifications**: Sends notification emails when jobs are executed.
6. **Global Error Handling**: All errors are logged and returned in a consistent format.
7. **Distribted Execution**: Multiple worker Instance can run in parallel.
8. **Graceful Shutdown**: On ShutDown the scheduler waits for any active job before exiting.
9. **Cron Polling**: Uses cron based polling for checking jobs.
10.**Metadata & Dead-Lettering**: Failed Jobs are retried upto a maximum limit and then it is forward towards dead-lettered.
11.**Monitoring & Alerting**: I have made a seperate folder and api end point '/metrics' which logs the dead-lettered.


## API Overview

- **Create Job**: `POST /api/job`
- **Get All Jobs**: `GET /api/job`
- **Get Job by ID**: `GET /api/job/:id`
- **Delete Job**: `DELETE /api/job/:id`
- **Get All Logs**: `GET /api/job-log`
- **Get Logs for a Job**: `GET /api/job-log/job/:jobId`
- **Get Log by Log ID**: `GET /api/job-log/:id`
- **Metrics**: `GET /metrics`
- **Swagger Docs**: `GET /api/docs`

## What I Learnt From this Project ?

-How to build a robust, persistent, and distributed job scheduler using NestJS, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

-The importance of distributed locking to prevent duplicate job execution in multi-worker environments.

-How to implement retry logic and dead-lettering for failed jobs.

-How to expose metrics for monitoring and integrate with Prometheus.

-How to implement graceful shutdown to ensure no jobs are lost or left incomplete.

-How to handle real-world backend challenges like error handling, crash recovery, and flexible scheduling.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
